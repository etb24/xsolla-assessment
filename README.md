# Repository Inspector

This is a small TypeScript developer tool that inspects changes in a Git
repository, runs optional validation commands, and produces a Markdown report.
It can be used from a command line or exposed to AI clients through MCP.

## Your task

Investigate the repository and improve it as you judge best. The starter works
for a narrow happy path, but production use may expose correctness, safety,
reliability, contract, output, documentation, or testing weaknesses.

You are not expected to finish everything. We care about how you investigate,
prioritize, implement, verify, and explain a meaningful scope.

## Product decision

This tool may be used directly by developers and by AI coding agents. Decide
whether its production interface should be **CLI-first**, **MCP-first**, or
**hybrid**. Implement improvements consistent with your decision.

There is no preferred label. Explain:

- The primary user and execution environment you assumed.
- The trust boundary and allowed capabilities.
- Reliability, discoverability, latency/context, and output-size tradeoffs.
- How the interfaces you continue to advertise stay behaviorally consistent.
- What evidence would change your decision.

## Time and rules

- Maximum **90 focused minutes** within 48 hours of receiving the invitation.
- Use AI coding tools freely. Verify their work and document at least one
  suggestion you corrected or rejected.
- Work in your own repository created from this template.
- Commit as you work and complete `SUBMISSION.md` in your final commit.
- Completion is not required. Accurate scope and verification matter more than
  a large diff.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## CLI

```bash
npm run inspector -- review --repo ./path/to/repo --format markdown
npm run inspector -- review --repo ./path/to/repo --validate "npm test"
npm run inspector -- review --repo ./path/to/repo --base-ref origin/main --format json
```

The report is written to `review-report.md` (`review-report.json` with
`--format json`). `--validate` accepts a shell command and may be repeated;
commands run sequentially in the target repo with a 120 s timeout each. The
CLI exits with code 1 if any validation command fails, so it can gate CI.

## MCP

Start the stdio server with:

```bash
npm run mcp-server
```

It exposes a `review_repository` tool with this input contract:

- `repo_path` (string, required) — absolute path to the repository.
- `base_ref` (string, optional) — base ref to diff against (default `main`).
- `validation_commands` (string[][], optional) — commands as argv arrays,
  e.g. `[["npm", "test"]]`. Unlike the CLI, these run **without a shell**
  (`execFile`), so shell syntax is not interpreted; per-command output in the
  report is capped at 10 000 characters to protect the caller's context.

Git failures (bad path, missing base ref) are returned as tool errors with a
clear message rather than crashing the server.
